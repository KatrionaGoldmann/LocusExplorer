### **About the Data**

The Pathobiology of Early Arthritis Cohort (PEAC) biomedical resource is a unique and comprehensive collection of samples from patients with early Arthritis together with high-density data including genomic and transcriptomic analysis, biologic tissue characterisation, state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging coupled with detailed clinical phenotyping. The PEAC consortium has been established through the contribution of independent, national centres of excellence. This resource is available to researchers through application to the PEAC Steering committee. More information can be found at [http://www.peac-mrc.mds.qmul.ac.uk/](http://www.peac-mrc.mds.qmul.ac.uk/).

## **Background**
There is a current imperative to unravel the hierarchy of molecular pathways that drive the progression of human autoimmune disorders. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) represents an ideal model autoimmune disease that can inform the sequence of events that drives transition of early to established disease. The specific aims of this project are to create an extensively phenotyped cohort of patients with early inflammatory arthritis with linked, detailed pathobiological data.

This study will generate a unique bio-medical resource with high-density data including gene expression profiling, proteomics, metabonomics, genotyping, serum and synovial fluid cyotokine & chemokine analysis, biological tissue characterisation, state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging, and detailed clinical phenotyping. This app integrates the genomics, transcriptomics and clinical traits from the PEAC study to explore the drivers of RA.
