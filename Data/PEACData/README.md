## QTL analysis of PEAC

This analysis looks at 120 synovial samples from subjects diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) prior to treatment. The transcriptomic data is mapped to the genomic data to determine which SNPs are statistically significant in gene expression. Thereafter we look at traits to perform a GWAS analysis. In particular we were interested in B cell modules/gene sets and pathotype.
